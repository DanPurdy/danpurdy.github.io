<p class="intro__text">I'm a Front End Developer from London. I currently work as a Senior Developer for <a class="intro__anchor" href="http://weareloft.com" target="_blank" title="Loft Digital website">Loft Digital</a> where I spend my day building complex web applications, responsive, standards compliant websites or working directly with companies on innovative prototypes.</p>

<p class="intro__text">Javascript, Sass, Html, CSS and a dash of PHP are my thing. Also, writing tests makes me happy. I'm a big open source advocate and personally contribute to and maintain several projects. I've also acted as a technical reviewer for several publications covering both web development and IoT.</p>
